1)	How did you hear about this job at ChefSteps?

	I saw the listing on LinkedIn. 

	However, I knew of ChefSteps before I applied was because of all the content on YouTube.  I particularly like the videos for the Apartment Ribs series, but in general I follow all the media content on Youtube.  I use the recipes on the website for alot of my holiday preparations.

2)	What is the best or most interesting meal you ate recently, and what did you like or dislike about it?
	
	Last week, I tried to do a tri-tip, Santa Maria style prepared Sous Vide.  The times I made it previously the garlic completely overpowered the flavor of the beef and had a very strong acrid flavor profile.

	This time I tried to do a lot of the seasoning after it cooked in an attempt to keep it from being too strong.  It turned out okay, I left it in the water for maybe 8 hours, which was far too long for me. It had the texture of steak and not the traditional mouth feel of a normal tri-tip.

	I bought a 3 pack from Costco, so I have one more go at it!

3)If someone gave you $1M and 2 engineers, what would you build?


4)In any language(s) of your choice, write a working function that removes all duplicates from an unsorted list of email addresses. You may assume any input data structure that you like. Do not use built-in library functions that make the problem trivial. Do not google any answers to this, I want to see your own implementation. 
	
	Requirements:
    Leave the resulting list in the original order (same as the input).
    The function should be able to handle 100,000 email addresses containing 50% randomly placed duplicates in well under 1 second on a typical modern laptop.
    Please include a simple test suite that demonstrates the above two requirements are met.
    Please deploy a demo live on the web somewhere for us to see. This should include your own simple frontend, not just a jsfiddle or repl.it. It is totally fine to put it up as a free heroku node for example. Send us both the deployed URL and the source code.
